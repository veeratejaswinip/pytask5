This Python script processes a sales dataset by grouping records based on the PRODUCTLINE column and calculating the total sales for each product category. Using Pandasâ€™ groupby() and sum() functions, it creates a summary table of sales performance. The aggregated results are visualized as a bar chart with Matplotlib, making it easy to compare revenue across different product lines. The chart includes descriptive labels, a title, and proper formatting for better readability, helping identify the top-performing product categories in the dataset.
