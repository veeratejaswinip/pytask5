This Python script reads a medical appointments dataset from a CSV file, groups the data by the Neighbourhood column, and calculates the total number of Scholarship recipients and SMS_received cases for
each neighborhood. Using Pandasâ€™ groupby() and sum() functions, it aggregates these counts into a summary table. 
Then, it visualizes the results as a bar chart with Matplotlib, showing how many people in each neighborhood received scholarships or SMS reminders. 
The plot includes labels, a title, and a larger figure size for better readability.
